## Hey, this is us 👋

![An illustration showing futuristic AI, web, and open API icons connected across a digital globe.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)

Yes, we are building **AI, modern web solutions, and open APIs**.  
In fact, we’ve been doing this since our very first commit — and since then we’ve shipped projects, opened issues, and contributed to open source across multiple repositories and communities. 🤯  

But that’s just us. We are proud to be part of the work of developers, companies, and innovators across the world. 🌍 Yes, humans *and* intelligent systems working together!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of how we build technology today. See for yourself:

- Contributions to open source projects across AI, web, and API ecosystems 🚀  
- Developers integrating with open APIs every single day 🏄  
- A growing network of collaborators pushing innovation forward 🌐  

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️ — are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started. Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run our projects, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source initiatives like:

- **AI Modules** – Smart solutions for automation and decision-making  
- **Web Frameworks** – Modern, modular, and audience-aware platforms  
- **Open API Tools** – Seamless integration across ecosystems  
- **Developer Resources** – Documentation, SDKs, and guides for global impact
